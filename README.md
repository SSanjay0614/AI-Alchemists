# Problem Statement:

## Streamlining Drug Discovery with AI and Machine Learning

The process of discovering new drugs is incredibly long and expensive. Scientists spend years testing different molecules to find out which ones can be effective treatments for diseases. This involves several steps that often rely on trial and error:

Target Identification: Researchers first identify biological targets (like proteins or enzymes) that play a role in the disease. This step is crucial but can be complex and time-consuming.

Manual Testing: Once potential drug candidates are developed, researchers create them in the lab and test each one to see how it behaves in the body. This includes checking how well the drug is absorbed, how it's metabolized, and if it's toxic.

Virtual Screening: Scientists then screen many potential drugs to find the ones that might work best. This process can be slow and requires a lot of resources.

Molecular Docking: Researchers create models of the target protein and manually test how well different drug candidates fit and bind to it using computer simulations. This can be a complicated and time-consuming process.

Overall, this traditional approach can take over a decade and cost billions of dollars, with many candidates failing late in the process due to issues that could have been identified earlier.

## Solution:

There is a need for a better way to discover drugs that reduces the time and costs involved. By using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), we can create a solution that automates and improves these processes.

## Goals:

Automate Target Identification: Use AI to quickly and accurately identify biological targets relevant to specific diseases, speeding up the initial phase of drug discovery.

Predict Drug Properties: Use AI to accurately predict how new drug candidates will perform in the body, eliminating the need for extensive lab testing for every compound.

Speed Up Screening: Implement AI-driven virtual screening to quickly identify the most promising drug candidates from large libraries of molecules.

Enhance Docking Simulations: Use AI to automate the creation of receptor protein models and improve how we test drug candidates for binding interactions, making the process faster and more reliable.

By leveraging AI and ML, we aim to make drug discovery faster, cheaper, and more efficient, ultimately helping to bring new treatments to patients sooner.

## Whose problem does it solve?

The long and expensive process of discovering new drugs affects many people, including pharmaceutical companies, researchers, patients, and healthcare systems. Companies spend a lot of money on research, but many drug candidates fail, leading to financial losses. 

Researchers often spend too much time on manual testing and simulations, which can slow down progress. Patients, especially those with serious illnesses, may have to wait longer for effective treatments. Our solution uses AI and machine learning to make the drug discovery process faster and cheaper, 

improving the chances of success for new drugs. This will help researchers focus on innovation, allow patients to access new treatments sooner, and reduce the strain on healthcare systems. Overall, our approach aims to benefit everyone by bringing effective drugs to market more quickly.
